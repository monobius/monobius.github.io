It's hot as hell<br>
And no one knows<br>
Just where it stops<br>
And where it goes<br>
I saw your face<br>
Late last night<br>
I touched<br>
You touched<br>
We touched all night<br>

You won't stop<br>
Your crying<br>
<br>
It's sad to see<br>
Just how you've changed<br>
Your face, your sheets<br>
All rearranged<br>
Is there no one else to call?<br>

Your crying<br>

I'm getting closer to<br>
Than I ever planned<br>
If I can't wake with you<br>
Then I'll sleep with your friends<br>
Is there no one else to call?<br>
Is there no one else to call?<br>
<br>
If I can't come with you<br>
Then you can't come with me<br>
If I come with your friends<br>
Maybe then you'll finally leave<br>

You're calling me more often<br>
Than you used to<br>
Say you missed me<br>
But I know he<br>
Broke your heart right into pieces<br>
<br>
Now we're all alone together<br>
Feels so real, but I know better<br>
Sad but flattered at the same time<br>
Glad you spent your day off with me<br>

Where were you<br>
When he said<br>
You needed space and needed time<br>
Did you leave your phone here?<br>

I think you did<br>
Come back and say good night<br>
Even though I said I once I'll say it twice<br>

<a name="gaze"></a><h1>5. Gaze</h1>
Apart<br>
Why start at the seam of the day<br>
Anachronic for a dream ending right as you pray<br>
Five down held a thought that was too soon to stay<br>
But who tries hard<br>
Who dies hard<br>
And who's sane for a moment in the temporal gray<br>
Granted pleasant isn't everything that's lit in the day<br>
Huh<br>
Looks heavy in reflections when you've felt every grain<br>
Every fiber<br>
Every fraction<br>
Every chain pours detail into misery banks<br>
It's the quiet in the loud that makes for miserable pay<br>
Cold levy in the jaw with an audible drain<br>
Could you stop now and go home<br>
Could you wait<br>
No option<br>
It's a question of pain<br>
Stop pleading for the sun to feel as right as the rain<br>
‘Cause there's no place like home and I'm not 'llowed to stay<br>
Hold your right hand to your left breast and<br>
<br>
Gaze<br>
Slow<br>
Fate<br>
(Oh)<br>
No<br>
<br>
Erupt in awe to the fell that you face<br>
Cut the letters to the laminate and hold it in place<br>
Little solace to the progress of the timely erased<br>
In struggle the will has no grace or ambivalence to cull the innate<br>
It's the certain of the curtain who lament the mistake<br>
But wouldn't feel a fucking finger with no nerve in the way<br>
Have I lost my affect to disdain for the impulse that put blood on a blade<br>
Lonely minute in the firmament for empathy prey<br>
Yet the reading of the writhing slightly opens the cage<br>
Climb back down<br>
Risk losing the frame<br>
Incautious is a terrible state<br>
But there's nothing on the ground to guide my hand to the plate<br>
God<br>
What's easy in indifference is a menace to aim<br>
How does one know where to rest their<br>
<br>
Gaze<br>
Low<br>
(Oh)<br>
Straight<br>
(Oh)<br>
Bow<br>
<br>
Intent<br>
Like effect's<br>
Not a measure of blame<br>
Like the impotent encouragement of virtue in vain<br>
Forges accuracy hollows in the depth of the vague<br>
But who tries hard<br>
And who dies slow<br>
It's not brave to demolish any signal depraved<br>
Counteractive to the stride that's spurred in stoking the flame<br>
Loss is anything by offering<br>
The hero you hate<br>
If my heart stops<br>
What have I gained?<br>

Gaze<br>
Woe<br>
(Oh)<br>
Gate<br>
(Oh)<br>
Close<br>

Back before the time I lost my dog<br>

Back when you stood<br>
On second and ninth<br>
Going to whatever show you'd find<br>

It was back then<br>
You had a car<br>
Had a bad leak, couldn't go too far<br>

Remember that time<br>
We drove to the bay?<br>
Just to hear somebody else play<br>

Silence as a punishment

Blue skies turn gray<br>
